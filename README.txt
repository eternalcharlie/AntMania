Midterm II bonus project "+10%"
------------------------

Your challenge:

Show you understand OO techniques to build a pacman-style game.

Your game should have -

* Well documented code. Comments explain WHY (and rarely what)
 
* A basic ghost class
* Sub-classes (e.g. EvilGhost, WalkThruWalls Ghost)
- I imagine that different ghosts will override the move and paint method

* Commented code - especially in any tricky game logic or
* particular design decisions.

* Classes with Constructors

* A GhostList class with at least an add method

* A static method that creates a list of different kinds of ghosts

* Some junit test cases that check that parts of your code work correctly

* Some interesting or novel game-play

You can work on this individually, in pairs or in threes but not fours.

The game....
... is upto you!

For points you will need to 
commit your code with @author netid1,netid2
and perform a code review (details after the next midterm)
You should also be prepared to demo your game

** Alternatively, you can create your own Android game. **
(You'll have to demo your code and check it in as a subversion project 
to get points)

Have fun!
